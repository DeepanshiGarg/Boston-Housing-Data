# Boston-Housing-Data
Reviewed the 'Boston Housing Dataset' and removed all the imperfections from it to perform analysis on it.

The first step was to find the type of bad data in all the columns, after doing that I replaced all those values with 'NAN' values so that the datatype of all the rows is the same. Further, we found the outliers through a boxplot in the 'PTRATIO' column so that we know, what can affect our overall analysis. And the final step was to omit and impute the bad values with mean, in order to use the data set for meaningful analysis.
